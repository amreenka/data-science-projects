# 🧠 Data Science Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains my data science project work as I learn and apply core concepts from online courses and hands-on exercises. These projects explore real-world datasets and use various techniques to analyze, visualize, and model data using Python.

## 📁 Projects Overview

| Project | Description | Techniques Used |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **House Price Prediction** | Analyze housing prices in King County and build predictive models using regression techniques | `LinearRegression`, `Ridge`, `PolynomialFeatures`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`, `R² Score` |
| **Data Science Ecosystem** | Overview of the data science ecosystem including tools, languages, and key terminology | `Markdown`, `Jupyter Notebook`, `Data Science Concepts` |
| **Final Assignment (Capstone-style)** | Summary project combining core Python, Markdown, and notebook skills from early coursework | `Python`, `Jupyter`, `Data Types`, `Basic Arithmetic`, `Markdown` |
